# Ideation

Ideation is the process of coming up with a potential solution with a problem, through a creative
process of brainstorming and elaboration. An idea does not necessarily need to be complete or even
feasible, as its mere existence can spark further discussion and expansion. Even if one were to
have a flash of insight and discover a new fully-formed solution to a problem, it should still be
run through an ideation process to explore potential problems and improvements.

## Resources produced:

* Vision statement
* Project summary
* Low fidelity prototype

# Specification

Specification is the process of digging deeper into a proposed solution and ensuring its
feasibility. Research should be carried out on the underlying science and other similar projects.
A detailed design of the proposed project should be developed to ensure a common and concrete
understanding of what is involved. And most importantly, a team must coalesce around an idea with
enough commitment to see it through to completion.

## Resources produced:

* Stakeholders
* Team
* Project specification
* Research report
* High fidelity prototype

# Business Case

A business case is an analytical document that converts the project idea and research into hard
facts and figures explaining why the project is worth spending money on. A typical business case
must make a convincing argument that investors in the project will receive more money from the
project than they put in. However, since the GIF projects are expected to provide returns to
sustainability instead of pure cash, the business case must argue that the benefits of the project
exceed the required costs to implement it. To make this case, costs and benefits must be quantified
and justified in detail.

* Business case

# Approval

Approval is the process of ensuring the overall feasibility of a project. While the business case
argues for a project’s economic feasibility, there are many other kinds, such as physical,
regulatory, political and social. An important yet somewhat abstract metric for the overall
feasibility of a project is its degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty can be offset by the credibility
of the team and of the other parties that have endorsed the project. Typically at least one credible
endorsement from outside the team would be required for any non-trivial project.

## Resources produced:

* Endorsements
* Partnerships

# Funding

Funding is the process of negotiating and acquiring the capital necessary to implement and operate
the project until completion. Funding can come from many sources, but the primary source of interest
here is the University of Melbourne’s Green Innovation Fund. Other sources might include company
sponsorship, philanthropists, alumni and crowdfunding. All of these sources will benefit from, if
not require, all of the resources produced in all of the previous phases.

# Implementation

Implementation is the process of actually turning the project vision into a reality. For example,
this could involve spending some funding to acquire and set up capital, and then monitoring the
equipment over time, both to gather data and maintain its condition. Some projects may also have
an end date at which some teardown process is required.

The project manager role is very important during implementation, since they are responsible for
detecting and tracking “issues” that arise over the life of the project. These issues are matter
that need to be addressed, but cannot be solved immediately and may need to be escalated outside
the team.

## Resources produced:

* Product
* Operational data
* Status reports
* Retrospective

# Scale

The idea behind Campus as a Lab is to run experiments, and if those experiments are successful, then
to replicate them beyond the campus. Following successful implementation, scaling is the process of
building on that success and either expanding the implementation on campus, or replicating and
growing the implementation outside the campus, perhaps on other campuses, in the city, or around
the world.

Scaling out in this way often requires additional funding, so the business case would need to be
revised to include the results of the implementation and considerations of new contexts. A project
is said to be “scalable” if for every dollar invested in the project, it returns more than a dollar
of benefit, whether it receives $100 or $1,000 or $1,000,000 (constant or increasing returns to
scale).

## Resources produced:

* Revised business plan
* More implementation

Note that the resources produced by truly scalable projects will be very valuable to other
successful projects considering taking their work to the next level, so do a great job of it!
